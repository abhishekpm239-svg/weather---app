weather.html – This is the main webpage. It has the structure of the weather app, like the search bar to enter a city name, and the space where the weather details (temperature, city, humidity, wind speed) will appear. Basically, this is the skeleton of the app.

wstyle.css – This file controls the design and look. It sets the background color, makes the card box rounded, adds gradients, changes font style, and positions everything neatly. Without this, the page would just look plain and boring.

images/ folder – This contains pictures like weather icons (sun, rain, clouds, etc.). The HTML uses these images to show the correct weather condition.
